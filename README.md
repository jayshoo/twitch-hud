# twitch-hud
> twitch dashboard in the terminal

begging for purpose,
my eleven inch netbook
appeared in a dream.

"i'm perfect for chat!
honor me with simple code,
i'll serve at your side."

(
expect sharp edges!
this student developer
is wrestling with rust.
)

## roadmap
- [ ] show twitch chat
- [ ] notify on network failure or stream degraded
- [ ] censor, timeout, ban chatters
